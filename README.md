# Implementation of a Kernel Perceptron for Handwritten Digit Classification
We implement various classifiers to recognise hand written digits. Note we generalise the perceptron implementations in two ways, first we use kernel functions so that we may generate a nonlinear separating surfaces and second, we use a majority network of perceptrons so that instead of separating only two classes we may separate k classes. <br />
For the kernels we consider the polynomial kernel, K(p, q) = (p . q)^d, parameterized by a positive integer d controlling the dimension of the polynomial and the gaussian kernel, K(p, q) = e^(-c||p-q||^2) where c is the width of the kernel. <br />
To generalise to k classes, we approached this using two strategies, the One vs One approach where we train a classifier for each pair of classes and the One vs All approach where k classifiers are trained, one for each class.
